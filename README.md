AlphaPeel is a software package for calling, phasing, and imputing genotype and sequence data in pedigree populations. This program implements single locus peeling, multi locus peeling, and hybrid peeling. A complete description of these methods is given in Hybrid peeling for fast and accurate calling, phasing, and imputation with sequence data of any coverage in pedigrees, Genetics Selection Evolution. 

Availability
============

The AlphaPeel.zip file contains executibles for Windows, Linux, and Mac, a manual, and an example dataset.

Conditions of use
